## Install

This project is developed in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). 


## Usage

### input parameters
[input_HEA.m](input_HEA.m) is the file where simulation parameters and material parameters are specified, start with this file to make sure the set up is correct.

### kMC/DD simulation
[dd3d_hea.m](dd3d_hea.m) is the main file, it is overall a kMC algorithm, and between each kMC events, DD simulations serve to fill the time interval. As the simulation runs, a movie of dislocation line motion will be created in real time. Also, the strain-vs-simulation time will be written into txt files for later analysis.
